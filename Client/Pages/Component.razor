            My regional Program Delivery Partner expressed challenges to generate FLL event schedules with agility to control break times, cycle times, etc.
            This app is a solution to enable generation of a useable event schedule.

            To use the app, follow these steps:
            <ol class="indented">
                <li>Launch the application in a modern browser, such as Chrome or Edge (the browser needs to support WebAssembly--a capability to run web apps)</li>
                <li>Start at the top and select a tournament profile that best matches your tournament</li>
                <li>Edit the Event parameters to fine tune to your specific requirements--tweak the buffer times, break times,
                    and cycle times to adequately model the schedule you run for your event,
                    and look for "gaps" generated in the schedule when a team cannot meet a specific time slot due to the parameters</li>
                <li>Click GENERATE SCHEDULES to compile your information and generate the schedules</li>
                <li>Click EXPORT EXCEL to download the schedules in Excel format</li>
                <li>Click EXPORT PDF to download the schedules in PDF format</li>
                <li>(Coming soon: logo file uploads, QR-code upload, multi-day support, afternoon opening ceremonies, API documentation)</li>
            </ol>
